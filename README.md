# FlipWare

A Warioware engine for Godot 4.

**Why?**

Because I noticed a sudden lack of Warioware fangames.



# How To Import Other Microgames
1. Download the .mgame file.
2. Open the folder .../app_userdata/FlipWare/microgames. ([More Info](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/io/data_paths.html#doc-data-paths))
3. Move the file in that folder.

Any microgame you create and save will be by default on the microgame folder.

4. Make the game reload microgames, moving to a different menu should be enough.
5. Now your very ~~terrible~~ original microgame may be selected on gameplay.


# How To Download Le Source Code
1. Download Godot version 4.0 BETA 7 or one more recent. (You may need to visit [Godot news tab](https://godotengine.org/news/default/1).)
2. Download the source code on a .zip file. (Press [ Code > Download ZIP ] on the code tab.)
3. **Import** the proyect on Godot using the .zip file.
4. Profit.
