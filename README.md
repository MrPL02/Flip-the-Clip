# WARNING!
The code sucks and I moved to other proyects, don't expect much.






# Flip the Clip
<sub>Previously known as Flipware</sub>


A Warioware fangame template for Godot 4.

**Why?**

Because I noticed a sudden lack of Warioware fangames and because I felt like it.
Also as an excuse to play with Godot 4.
